# Chatbot_NLP
A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person.

# Why Chatbot?
Chatbots boost operational efficiency and bring cost savings to businesses while offering convenience and added services to internal employees and external customers. They allow companies to easily resolve many types of customer queries and issues while reducing the need for human interaction.

# Data Source
Intents.json file contains all the possible outcomes of user interactions with our chatbot. We first need a set of tags that users can use to categorize their queries.Every new tag would require a unique pattern.
chatbot.ipynb contains the python code.
